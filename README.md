[C# Exercises:]

Write a method TwoMax that takes two integer arguments and returns the largest. (Do not use any built-in max() function. Write if statements.)

Write a method ThreeMax that takes three arguments and returns the largest of them. (Once again, do not use any built-in max().)

Write a method StartsWithVowel that takes a character and returns the boolean true if it is a vowel, false otherwise.

Write a method PalindromeCheck that recognizes palindromes (i.e. words that read the same backward or foreward). For example, is_palindrome("radar") should return True.

Write a method named OddArray that takes an array of integers and returns a new array that only contains those numbers that are odd.

Write a method Multiply that multiplies all the numbers in a list of integers and returns the product.

Write a method IsSorted that takes a list of doubles as a parameter and returns true if the list is sorted in ascending order and false otherwise.

Write a method Lowest that takes an array of integers and returns the value of the smallest element.

Write a method Dups that takes a list of characters and returns the number of duplicates in the list.

Write a method LowestValue that takes a dictionary of string, integer key-value pairs. (The strings can be fruit inventory, such as "apple" and "pear" and the integers are inventory remaining, like 3.) Have the method return the smallest value in the dictionary.

A pangram is a sentence that contains all the letters of the English alphabet at least once, for example: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. Write a methold PangramCheck to check a sentence to see if it is a pangram or not.

Write a method LoShu that accepts a two-dimensional array as an argument and returns whether or not the array is a Lo Shu Magic Square. Lo Shu Magic Square have three rows and three columns, where the numbers 1 through 9 occur exactly once, and the sum of each row, each column, and each diagonal all add up to the same number.

Write a method FilterLongWords that takes a list of words and an integer n and returns the list of words, CAPITALIZED, that are longer than n.

Write a method TopTen that takes a dictionary of string, integer key-value pairs. (Imagine that the strings are names, such as "Rich" and the integers are high scores, like 300000000.) Have the method return a string, integer key-value dictionary that only contains the ten highest scores.
